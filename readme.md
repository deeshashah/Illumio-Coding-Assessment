#### Readme file for Illumio coding exercise:

The code for the solution exists in the file 'Firewall.py'

Way to run the code:

Open a shell/terminal on a machine


```python
> python Firewall.py
```

The input to the function can be changed to test a particular input. 

Edge cases like empty input, out of range input have been tested in this code. 

The time complexity of the code is `O(n)`

I tried to optimize the code and try to achieve a `O(log n)` complexity using some sort of binary search, but it would take longer.
